# DAST - Dtatic Application Security Testing

### What is SAST?
DAST works by using automation that simulates different malicious attacks on an application while itâ€™s running. The outcome is to detect if there are any unexpected or undetected code or security defects that can be exploited by an attacker. Cross-site scripting, command and SQL injection errors, path traversal, and insecure server configuration are a few of those security risks that can be detected by DAST.

Synonyms: `Black Box Testing`, `Penetration Testing`
